Whatever you’re craving, we’ve got something here that’ll fill any breakfast-sandwich-shaped holes in your heart. I’m talking about the green goddess sandwich that’s zingy, hearty, and packed with a (subjectively) serious amount of your daily veg needs.

Or, for the sandwich liberalists, this cheesy, no-fuss breakfast burrito that scores high on the portable, compact, and delicious scales.

All you need is chicken, olive oil, salt, and pepper (and maybe some stock or white wine for gravy).We usually buy whole chickens and either cut them up ourselves or have the butcher do it for us. It's cheaper that way and we get giblets for gravy. You can do that or just use a package of whatever chicken parts you like—make baked chicken breasts for white meat, and baked chicken thighs and legs for dark.",

Oscar Tschirky, the maître d'hôtel, was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham for the bacon and a toasted English muffin for the toast.",

He waxed poetic about the deliciousness for a good five minutes, but I wasn’t sold. Mike was nodding along, agreeing with him because he’s eaten many a full English in London, but me? Nope.",
